        "description": "It’s easy to forget about your lungs. Most of the time they’re taking care of business all on their own. Typically, we only think about our lungs when we have a breathing problem or cough. Luckily, the human body has natural defenses to keep the lungs healthy. Your body automatically tries to remove harmful substances or irritants. However, there are still things you can do to promote good lung health. The following recommendations come from the American Lung Association. You can explore their research, reports, and clinical trials here.  se regularly Physical activity can help keep your lungs healthy. The oxygen you breathe in enters your lungs, moves to the blood, and travels to the cells of your body. When your physical fitness improves, your body becomes better at putting oxygen into the bloodstream. You can choose from plenty of exercise options no matter your age or physical capabilities.  ",
